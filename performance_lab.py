# üîç Problem 1: Find Most Frequent Element
# Given a list of integers, return the value that appears most frequently.
# If there's a tie, return any of the most frequent.
#
# Example:
# Input: [1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3]
# Output: 3

    return Counter(numbers).most_common(1)[0][0]

Time and Space Analysis for problem 1:
- Best-case: O(n) ‚Äî one pass to count frequencies
- Worst-case: O(n) ‚Äî same as best, since all elements must be counted
- Average-case: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n) ‚Äî storing frequency of each unique element
- Why this approach? Counter is optimized for frequency counting and provides direct access to the most common element
- Could it be optimized? Only marginally; a manual dictionary approach avoids importing but doesn't improve complexity

# üîç Problem 4: Simulate List Resizing (Amortized Cost)
# Create a function that adds n elements to a list that has a fixed initial capacity.
